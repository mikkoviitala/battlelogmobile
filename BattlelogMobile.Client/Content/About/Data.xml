<!-- To use YLAD, do the following: 
     * Adjust this configuration file to your personal needs: change entries and labels, add more items etc.
     * Anywhere in your application, for example in an application bar button click event handler, put the
       required code that initiates navigation to the about screen:

       NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/YourLastAboutDialog;component/AboutPage.xaml", UriKind.Relative));

    For more information on the powerful additional options and features of YLAD, like localization, support
    of trial mode, remote and local rich XAML and text content etc., please refer to the documentation that 
    is available at:

<About>
  <!-- The App element allows you to override the values that are extracted from the WMAppManifest.xml file automatically -->
  <!-- The AdditionalNotes attribute has no equivalent in the WMAppManifest.xml; you can only define its content here -->
  <!-- Explicitly set any of the attributes to an empty string to remove it (including its label) from the dialog -->
  <!--<App Author="[Your name here]"
       Publisher="[Publisher]"       
       AdditionalNotes="[Fill in additional info here]" />-->
  <App Author=""
       Publisher=""
       Description=""
       AdditionalNotes="Battlelog Mobile is a open source project. It was not developed by EA / DICE and has nothing to do with official Battlefield 3 or Battlelog products." />
  <Items>
    <!-- Create a MainItem entry to configure the front page -->
    <!-- The Titel attribute defines the title of the pivot item -->
    <!-- The Label (and review button content) attributes can override the default values to what you like, and also help with localization -->
    <!-- By default, the "Buy this app!" button is only shown when the app runs in trial mode (more on trial mode and how to configure YLAD accordingly here:
          http://ylad.codeplex.com/documentation). Explicitly set any of the button contents to an empty string to override the default behavior, and remove the button from the page. -->

    <!-- For each additional pivot item, add a separate Item entry. Ideas for items are: license, tutorial or help, version history, show room for other apps from you etc. -->
    <!-- The Title attribute defines the title of the pivot item -->
    <!-- Each Item can be a remote item (fetched from a Uri) or a local item (using its content), or both (local content is the fallback value if fetching the network content fails) -->
    <!-- Supported types are "text" and "xaml", where text is nicely formatted automatically, and XAML is handled by the built-in XamlReader -->
