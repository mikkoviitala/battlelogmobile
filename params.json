{"name":"Battlelog Mobile for Windows Phone","tagline":"Battlefield 3 stats made easy!","body":"# Description\r\nBattlelog Mobile retrieves your real time [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3) soldier information from EA / DICE Battlelog server to your Windows Phone. You are able to track your progression in easy, intuitive manner with lots of images and charts. Get yours from [Microsoft Marketplace](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0), for free. This project will stay active until EA / DICE provide their own Windows Phone application.\r\n\r\nAll three platforms are supported (PC, PS3, XBox). \r\n\r\nBattlelog Mobile is a open source project and it has nothing to do with official EA / DICE Battlefield 3 or Battlelog products. Git project page can be found [right here](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile).\r\n\r\nThanks to awesome community, that made my life easier, namely [AmCharts](https://github.com/ailon/amCharts-Quick-Charts), [MVVMLight](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/), [JSON.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/), [GZip WebClient](https://github.com/dotMorten/SharpGIS.GZipWebClient), [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/), [Tomers Phone Control](https://bitbucket.org/aiken/aikenlist/src/0ed0058743ee/Tomers.Phone.Controls?at=default), [YLAD](http://ylad.codeplex.com/) and [WP7 Continuous Integration](http://wp7ci.codeplex.com/).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that this application DOES NOT access your media library, does not use your phone services, identity or anything \"weird\" that has nothing to do with application logic. These are simply mandatory access rights needed by Microsoft Advertising SDK. You will see ad on login page, or none at all depending on your current location.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Status\r\nVersion 2.0.0.0 is now available for download from Marketplace. \r\nSee the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/issues) \r\nif you want to know what is being developed for next release. You are also welcome to contact us via email or Battlelog.
