{"body":"# Description\r\nBattlelog Mobile retrieves your real time [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3) soldier information from EA / DICE Battlelog server to your Windows Phone. You are able to track your progression in easy, intuitive manner with lots of images and charts. Get yours from [Microsoft Marketplace](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0), for free. \r\n\r\nAll three platforms are supported (PC, PS3, XBox). \r\n\r\nBattlelog Mobile is a open source project and it has nothing to do with official EA / DICE Battlefield 3 or Battlelog products. Git project page can be found [right here](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile).\r\n\r\nThanks to Open Source community that made my life that much easier, namely [AmCharts](https://github.com/ailon/amCharts-Quick-Charts), [MVVMLight](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/), [JSON.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/), [GZip WebClient](https://github.com/dotMorten/SharpGIS.GZipWebClient), [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/), [Tomer Phones Control](https://bitbucket.org/aiken/aikenlist/src/0ed0058743ee/Tomers.Phone.Controls?at=default), [YLAD](http://ylad.codeplex.com/) and [WP7 Continuous Integration](http://wp7ci.codeplex.com/).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that this application DOES NOT access your media library, does not use the phone services, your identity or nothing \"weird\" that has nothing to do with application logic. These are simply mandatory access rights needed by Microsoft Advertising SDK. You will see ad on login page, or none at all depending on your current location.\r\n\r\n# Status\r\nVersion 1.8.0.0 (The Aftermath DLC release) is available for download from Marketplace. \r\nSee the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/issues) \r\nif you want to know what is being developed for next release. You are also welcome to contact us via email or Battlelog. Every contribution is mentioned in About page.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nOn December 8th 2012 the \"magic limit\" of 10000 downloads was broken, with average of 50 downloads per day and 4-out-of-5 star reviews. Thank you very much for your support, fellow gamers!!!1\r\n\r\n![App Hub Stats](https://raw.github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/master/public/apphubstat.png)\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n* [battlelogmobile@inbox.com](mailto:battlelogmobile@inbox.com)\r\n* [Mustavuori](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/user/Mustavuori/) @ Battlelog\r\n\r\n# Pages\r\n* [GitHub project](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile)\r\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/BattlelogMobile)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
