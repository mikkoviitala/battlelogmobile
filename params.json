{"name":"Battlelog Mobile for Windows Phone","tagline":"Battlefield 3 stats made easy!","body":"# Description\r\nBattlelog Mobile retrieves your real time [Battlefield 3](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3) soldier information from EA / DICE Battlelog server to your Windows Phone. You are able to track your progression in easy, intuitive manner with lots of images and charts. Get yours from [Microsoft Marketplace](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0), for free. This project will stay active until EA / DICE provide their own Windows Phone application.\r\n\r\nAll three platforms are supported (PC, PS3, XBox). \r\n\r\nBattlelog Mobile is a open source project and it has nothing to do with official EA / DICE Battlefield 3 or Battlelog products. Git project page can be found [right here](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile).\r\n\r\nThanks to awesome community, that made my life easier, namely [AmCharts](https://github.com/ailon/amCharts-Quick-Charts), [MVVMLight](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/), [JSON.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/), [GZip WebClient](https://github.com/dotMorten/SharpGIS.GZipWebClient), [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/), [Tomers Phone Control](https://bitbucket.org/aiken/aikenlist/src/0ed0058743ee/Tomers.Phone.Controls?at=default), [YLAD](http://ylad.codeplex.com/) and [WP7 Continuous Integration](http://wp7ci.codeplex.com/).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that this application DOES NOT access your media library, does not use your phone services, identity or anything \"weird\" that has nothing to do with application logic. These are simply mandatory access rights needed by Microsoft Advertising SDK. You will see ad on login page, or none at all depending on your current location.\r\n\r\n# Status\r\nVersion 1.9.0.0 (The End Game DLC release) is available for download from Marketplace. \r\nSee the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/issues) \r\nif you want to know what is being developed for next release (...if any, since this is last DLC and BF4 is on the way). You are also welcome to contact us via email or Battlelog. Every contribution is mentioned in About page.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nOn December 8th 2012 the \"magic limit\" of 10000 downloads was broken, with average of 50 downloads per day and 4-out-of-5 star reviews (from 26 different countries). Thank you very much for your support, fellow gamers!!!1\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nMainly because of your good reviews, daily downloads has been plunged to nearly 200 per day and 20k downloads was broken on March 27th 2013! Please DO wait for Battlelog Mobile for Battlefield 4 :) \r\n\r\n![Dev Center Stats](https://raw.github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/master/public/apphubstat.png)\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n* [battlelogmobile@inbox.com](mailto:battlelogmobile@inbox.com)\r\n* [Mustavuori](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/user/Mustavuori/) @ Battlelog\r\n\r\n# Pages\r\n* [GitHub project](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile)\r\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/BattlelogMobile)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
