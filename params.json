{"name":"Battlelog Mobile for Windows Phone","tagline":"Battlefield statistics made easy!","body":"[![Store](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/blob/master/public/154x40_WPS_Download_revgry.png?raw=1)](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0)\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nBattlelog Mobile retrieves your real time [Battlefield](http://www.battlefield.com) soldier information from EA / DICE Battlelog servers to your Windows Phone. You are able to track your progression in easy, intuitive manner with lots of images and charts. Download now from [Windows Phone Store](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0), for free. \r\n\r\nAll five platforms are supported (PC, PS4, PS3, XBox One, XBox 360). \r\n\r\nBattlelog Mobile is a open source project and it has nothing to do with official EA / DICE Battlefield or Battlelog products. Git project page can be found [right here](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile). This project will stay active until EA / DICE provides their own Windows Phone application.\r\n\r\nThanks to awesome community, that made my life easier, namely [AmCharts](https://github.com/ailon/amCharts-Quick-Charts), [MVVMLight](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/), [JSON.NET](http://json.codeplex.com/), [GZip WebClient](https://github.com/dotMorten/SharpGIS.GZipWebClient), [Silverlight Toolkit](http://silverlight.codeplex.com/), [Tomers Phone Control](https://bitbucket.org/aiken/aikenlist/src/0ed0058743ee/Tomers.Phone.Controls?at=default), [YLAD](http://ylad.codeplex.com/), [WP7 Continuous Integration](http://wp7ci.codeplex.com/) and [Sharp Serializer](http://sharpserializer.codeplex.com/).\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that this application DOES NOT access your media library, does not use your phone services, identity or anything \"weird\" that has nothing to do with application logic. These are simply mandatory access rights needed by Microsoft Advertising SDK. You will see ad on login page, or none at all depending on your current location.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Status\r\nLatest available version is 3.0 released May 8th, 2014. This includes new milestone, namely [Battlefield 4](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4) support.\r\nSee the [pulse](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/pulse) \r\nfor status of application development.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n* [battlelogmobile@inbox.com](mailto:battlelogmobile@inbox.com)\r\n\r\n# Pages\r\n* [Windows Phone Store](http://windowsphone.com/s?appId=003ef672-e898-4564-8799-7bd258060cc0)\r\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/BattlelogMobile)\r\n* [Repository pulse](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile/pulse)\r\n* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikkoviitala/battlelogmobile)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
